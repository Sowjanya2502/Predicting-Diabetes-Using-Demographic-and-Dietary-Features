# Introduction
This project focuses on predicting the presence of diabetes using demographic, behavioral, and dietary information from the 2022 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) dataset.
- The primary objective is to identify key factors associated with diabetes risk and to build classification models that can accurately predict diabetes based on easily available survey variables.
- I have explored Support Vector Machine (SVM) models with linear, radial basis function (RBF), and polynomial kernels to understand how different types of relationships between features and outcomes affect predictive performance.
- Key predictors investigated include age, body mass index (BMI), salad and sugary drink consumption, and marital status.
This project not only applies machine learning for health prediction but also highlights how biological, lifestyle, and social factors jointly contribute to chronic disease risk.
